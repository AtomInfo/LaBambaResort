📁 Project Structure:
- `src/components/` → Individual React components (Navbar, Header, About, Menu, etc.)
- `src/App.js` → Main layout and routing
- `src/index.js` → Entry point
- `src/styles/` → CSS or CSS modules (or Tailwind if you prefer)

Use only React (no Redux or advanced state unless necessary). Keep code modular and well-commented. Keep it easy to expand later (e.g., by adding a booking page).
